# Super Mario Bros. 3 - Clone

Clone of the famous SMB3 game using vanilla Javascript leveraging the use of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Canvas API.

## Installation
I recommend using Live Server to run the game. Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the Live Server globally.

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

## Usage
Inside the main folder of the source code type the following.

```bash
live-server
```

You can also run Live Server with the VS Code extension.

## Deployed game
You can find a deployed version of the game in the following [link](https://weabreus.github.io/mario-clone/).
